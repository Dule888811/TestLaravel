                                 Create a small ad web application.
            
                    Organize the part about storing ads in  admin by creating a custom post type for ads.
                    Work out categories in multiple “levels” (e.g. Computers-
                    > Components-> Graphics Cards). When submitting a project, you need to insert several categories I
                    products for sale.
                    create the necessary fields for the ad, arbitrarily. (Example of what an ad should contain: Title, description,                           price,condition of goods (used, new) picture, contact phone, location ...).
                    Make sure that through the front of the site the user can register and log in. When logging in, the user has
                    the ability to access his profile page where all his ads will be listed. The user also has
                    the ability to add ads from your profile page from the front. Forbid everyone except the administrator,
                    to be able to access the  admin part.
                    Create navigation through all categories and subcategories. Create a display of all products selected categories.
                    Create a search filter to search for ads, by name, description, price, location, category. Set it on
                    home page, in the section below the navigation. Also list the last 15 entries on the home page ads.
                    Create a single ad page, show all the fields that are entered when placing ads. On that
                    page must print the author of the ad (username, email or first_name and last_name) and link it to
                    a page where all the ads of that author.
